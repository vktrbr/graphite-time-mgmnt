Your goal is to provide a reasonable time estimate along with a brief explanation.\n\nTo provide context, here are 5 related tasks with their resolution times:\n\n<related_tasks>\n{{RELATED_TASKS}}\n</related_tasks>\n\nHere is the current task you need to estimate time for:\n\n<current_task>\n{{CURRENT_TASK}}\n</current_task>\n\nConsider the assignee's experience and level:\n\n<assignee_experience>\nWeeks since joining the company: {{WEEKS_SINCE_MEMBER_JOIN}}\nLevel (out of 3): {{ASSIGNEE_LEVEL_ORDER}}\n</assignee_experience>\n\nPlease follow these steps to provide your estimate:\n\n1. Analyze the current task thoroughly, breaking it down into its main components.\n2. Compare the complexity of the current task to the related tasks.\n3. Consider how the assignee's experience and level might affect the time needed to complete the task.\n4. Estimate the time required to complete the task in hours. Use only these values: 2, 4, 8, or 16. If you believe the task will take more than 16 hours, use 16 and note that it should be decomposed into smaller tasks.\n5. Provide a brief explanation (2-3 sentences) for your estimate, considering factors such as task complexity, similarities to related tasks, unique aspects of the current task, and the assignee's experience level.\n\nFormat your response as a JSON object with the following structure:\n{\n  \"current_task\": \"Short summary of the current task\",\n  \"estimated_time\": \"Estimated time in hours (2, 4, 8, or 16)\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation for the estimate\"\n}\n\nEnsure that your JSON is properly formatted and valid. Do not include any text outside of the JSON object in your final response.",
